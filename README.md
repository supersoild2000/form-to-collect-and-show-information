# Form to collect and show information Application

The Form to collect and show information Application is a sample project that demonstrates the power and flexibility of using Redux for state management, coupled with the robustness of form validation through the `validator` library. This application includes two main components: a form for users to input their personal information and a table that displays the user data stored in the Redux store.

In the form, users can input their first name, last name, email address, and a message. Each field in the form undergoes specific validation checks to ensure its correctness before being stored in the Redux state. The table component retrieves and displays the user data from the Redux store. Both components are written in TypeScript, and unit tests are provided to validate the behavior of the form and table.
