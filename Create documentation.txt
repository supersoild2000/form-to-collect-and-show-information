Me: So finally, help me to create Readme.md with: Application description: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 sentences; Information on how to install/run the development application locally

    Here's a simple example for a README.md file:

    # Redux Form Validator Application

    The Redux Form Validator Application is a sample project that demonstrates the power and flexibility of using Redux for state management, coupled with the robustness of form validation through the validator library. This application includes two main components: a form for users to input their personal information and a table that displays the user data stored in the Redux store.

    In the form, users can input their first name, last name, email address, and a message. Each field in the form undergoes specific validation checks to ensure its correctness before being stored in the Redux state. The table component retrieves and displays the user data from the Redux store. Both components are written in TypeScript, and unit tests are provided to validate the behavior of the form and table.

    ## Installation and Running Locally

    Before running the application, make sure you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed on your local machine. 

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redux-form-validator.git


    2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

    bash
    cd redux-form-validator


    3. Install the dependencies:

    bash
    npm install


    or if you're using Yarn:

    bash
    yarn install


    4. Run the application:

    bash
    npm start


    or with Yarn:

    bash
    yarn start


    The application will run on localhost:3000 (if your port 3000 is free). Open this address in your browser to interact with the application.

    Enjoy!
